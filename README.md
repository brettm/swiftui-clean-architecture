# CleanArchitectureSwiftUI

CleanArchitectureSwiftUI is a demo iOS app written in Swift using SwiftUI that demonstrates clean architecture principles and best practices. It showcases various features including programmable navigation state, app routing and deep linking, theming, internationalization, accessibility, multi-platform support, unit testing, reactive MV architecture, asynchronous programming, ease of feature extension, error handling, networking, persistence, and analytics integration.

## Features

- **Programmable Navigation State**: Utilises SwiftUI's navigation state management and enums for a flexible and dynamic navigation flow.
- **App Routing and Deep Linking**: Implements deep linking and routing for seamless navigation within the app.
- **Theming**: Supports theming for consistent and customisable user interface styling.
- **Internationalisation**: Provides support for multiple languages and locales.
- **Accessibility**: Prioritises accessibility features for users with diverse needs.
- **Multi-Platform**: Designed to work seamlessly across iOS devices.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
- **Reactive MV Architecture**: Adopts a reactive Model-View architecture for efficient data flow and UI updates.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Uses asynchronous programming patterns for handling background tasks and networking.
- **Ease of Feature Extension**: Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, making it easy to add new features.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling mechanisms for graceful failure recovery.
- **Networking**: Integrates with network services for fetching and updating data.
- **Persistence**: Utilises Swift Data for local data storage.
- **Analytics**: Incorporates analytics tools to track user interactions, app performance and A/B testing.
